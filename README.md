- 👋 Hi, I'm @mar-we-tech, a deaf myselflearned-dev. 
- 👀 I'm interested in writing code and making something new.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning 2D and 3D in C#. I am currently using Godot to make a 3D based tower defense game.
- 💞️ I'm willing to work on anything! I want to learn and would be happy to work with someone on some projects.
- @ How to reach me: MarWe0410@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I just started learning to code for real a few months ago. Before I was just like touching and understanding, but not doing it myself.
