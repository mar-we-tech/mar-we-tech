👋 Hi, I'm @mar-we-tech – a deaf, self-taught developer and future IT professional.

👀 I love writing code and creating new things from scratch.

🌱 I'm currently learning 2D and 3D game development in Godot, GameMaker, and more. Right now, I'm working in GameMaker on a special 2D game for someone close to me.

💞️ I'm open to collaborating on any kind of project! I'm eager to learn and would be happy to work together with others.

📬 You can reach me at marwe-tech@gmail.com

😄 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Future goal: I'd love to own a 3D printer one day to build even more awesome things!
